# leet-code-nodejs

My repo for popular DSA problems that I use to practice TypeScript and review CS concepts. 

Has a suite of test cases written in jest. I usually write edge cases in jest when I can't immediately solve the problem.

Has some failing tests despite that I've implemented the accepted solutions. I think there are some bugs in the runtime
(so this deserves some review)

## Install
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Run the tests
```bash
$ npm run test
```
